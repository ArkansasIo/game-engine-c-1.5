# 🧠 Tips for Best Results

1. Use detailed prompts

"Low-poly sci-fi mining drone, orange hazard stripes, PBR textures, game-ready"

2. Keep a style guide

color palette

lighting style

polygon count

texture resolution

3. Optimize before engine import

reduce poly count

bake textures

export to FBX/GLTF

## ✔️ Recommended Workflow (Indie MMO/RPG)

Since you're building RPG/MMORPG systems:

Generate concepts → Scenario / Pixelcut

Create 3D props → Meshy / Sloyd

Make icons & UI → Recraft / Pixelcut

Export → Blender cleanup → Unreal import

If you want, I can also:

✅ list best free-only tools
✅ generate prompt templates for RPG/MMO assets
✅ suggest Unreal-ready asset workflow
✅ create assets for your game style
