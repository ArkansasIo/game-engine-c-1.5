# Game Lore: Rise of the GoonZu

## The World of Luminae
Long ago, the world of Luminae was shaped by ancient gods, who left behind powerful relics and mysterious ruins. The land is divided into diverse regions—lush forests, arid deserts, icy mountains, and bustling cities—each with its own history and secrets.

## The Age of Heroes
Centuries ago, the first GoonZu united the fractured towns and brought peace through wisdom and strength. The GoonZu’s legacy is one of leadership, innovation, and sacrifice. Every generation, a new GoonZu is chosen by the people to guide the world through prosperity and peril.

## The Shadow Returns
Now, darkness stirs once more. Monsters grow bolder, ancient evils awaken, and political intrigue threatens the fragile peace. The mysterious Black Sun cult seeks to resurrect a forgotten god, while rival towns vie for power and resources.

## The Player’s Journey
You are an adventurer, drawn to Luminae by fate. Will you rise as a hero, master the arts of magic and combat, and shape the future as the next GoonZu? Or will you carve your own legend through trade, politics, or exploration?
